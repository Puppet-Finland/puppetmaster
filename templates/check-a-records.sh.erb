# This script verifies that all Puppet nodes have valid DNS records. This is
# particularly useful trick when some modules require realization of exported
# firewall resources coming from multiple nodes. This is the case, for example,
# for the bacula-storagedaemon class which gets it's firewall resources from the
# bacula-filedaemon nodes, and any missing or duplicate IP addresses would cause
# a puppet run to bail out.
#
# This script operates on a node list based on signed Puppet certificates, and
# thus requires that the certificate name matches the DNS name of the nodes.
